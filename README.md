# AditiFastFood

As part of B.Tech. MAD Subject Project (6th Semester, team of three), we used techniques like Android Studio, Java, Google Firebase, and Razor Pay to develop a food ordering app. The app was designed to enable users to schedule their orders at a particular time at Aditi restaurant, NMIMS Shirpur, with the aim of saving time by avoiding long queues during lunch breaks.

We integrated Google Firebase into the app for secure authentication for sign-up and sign-in. We also used Razor Pay as the payment gateway to enable users to make online payments for their orders.

The app features a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse the menu, select their preferred dishes, and add them to their cart. They can also select the time at which they want their order to be ready for pickup.

Overall, our food ordering app provides a seamless and convenient way for users to order food from Aditi restaurant, NMIMS Shirpur, while saving time during their busy lunch breaks.
